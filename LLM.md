For the sake of clarity and relevance as well as personal impact, I made some major revisions to my updated portfolio. I changed the title to best represent my MBA journey with ‚ÄúMBA Portfolio: ‚ÄúKarma Galley‚Äù as a professional and descriptive heading. The ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù section was revised to reflect my double professional experience and to illustrate how keen I am to contribute to positive social and economic change especially in under served areas. I moved from general job roles to specific organisations I worked for to support my profile and added concise bullet points that identify my huge contributions and achievements. I streamlined the skills section to emphasize the practical skills in line with my MBA course work and the skills I want to develop in the future. I ended the portfolio with a contact section that would make it easy for potential contacts to be in touch with me during my career. Such changes make the portfolio informative and really reflect my personal experiences and hopes.
